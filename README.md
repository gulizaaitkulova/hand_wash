# Hand Wash Timer
![box](assets/box.jpg)    
Welcome to the Touchless Musical Hand Wash Timer project! Our goal is to help stop the spread of Covid-19 and improve hygiene discipline in a fun and interesting way. This is the final project of the team LG for Creative ISE Design class.

This touchless hand wash timer displays a countdown clock to remind users to wash their hands for the recommended amount of time, and also displays the room's humidity and temperature. Additionally, it plays music while the timer is running to make the hand washing process more enjoyable.

The target audience for this project is students at INHA University, and it can be used in the university's restrooms. Our aim is to raise awareness about the importance of handwashing and encourage people to adopt proper hygiene habits.

We hope you find this project useful and informative. Thank you for your interest!
